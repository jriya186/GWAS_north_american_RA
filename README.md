# GWAS Analysis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (NARAC Dataset)

This project was my final course project, where I explored the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) GWAS dataset to investigate genetic associations with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The goal was to perform quality control, sex-stratified genome-wide association studies, and polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis, highlighting both methodology and findings.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Individuals: 2,062 (868 RA cases, 1,194 controls)
Variants: ~544,000 SNPs before QC
Publicly available GWAS dataset curated by NARAC.
